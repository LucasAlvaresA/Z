## Project Overview

This is a **Frontend-only** project built using **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **TailwindCSS**. There is **no backend** or **API requests** involved in this project. The primary goal of this project is to display the frontend and its functionalities, which include a user interface with interactive components and dynamic content rendering.

The project demonstrates various frontend features and components such as navigation, layout design, and UI elements, but it doesn't interact with any external server or database.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy of this project up and running, follow these simple example steps.

### Installation

-   Clone the repo:

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:LucasAlvaresA/Z.git
    ```

-   Install NPM packages:

    **Note:** If you encounter issues with conflicts or incompatible package versions during installation, run the following command to force the installation of dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install --force
    ```

    The `--force` flag is used to ignore warnings about incompatible versions of packages and ensure that all dependencies are installed correctly.

-   Run the project:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

### Routes

Since this project is built with **Next.js**, the routing is handled automatically using the **File System-based Routing**.

Here are some of the main routes:

-   `/` — The homepage of the project, where the main content and layout are displayed.
-   `/signin` — A demo page for the user sign-in process with a form layout (no backend functionality).
-   `/signup` — A placeholder page demonstrating a user sign-up form (no backend functionality).
-   `/profile` — A profile page showcasing the layout for user information display (static content).

You can add more pages or modify the existing ones by simply adding new files to the **`pages/`** directory.

## Conclusion

This project is a simple frontend-focused application designed to showcase various web development concepts and UI elements. Since there is no backend or API integration, all interactions and functionality are purely client-side.

Feel free to explore, modify, and expand upon this project as you see fit.
